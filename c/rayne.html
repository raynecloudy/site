    <p>rayne is my persona. he's 15, uses he/they pronouns, and is a femboy.</p>
    <h3>lore</h3>
    <p>rayne is the encompassing entity of <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a> and <a href="/c/hayley.html">hayley</a>'s personalities. he depicts traits of both personalities, both psychologically (f.e. mellow, like <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a>, but also happy-go-lucky at times, like <a href="/c/hayley.html">hayley</a>) and physically (f.e. <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a>'s hairstyle, <a href="/c/hayley.html">hayley</a>'s hairpin).</p>
    <p>note that he does NOT have multiple personality disorder- he is the result of <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a> and <a href="/c/hayley.html">hayley</a> being merged into one person and sense of self.</p>
    <p>before <a href="/c/hayley.html">hayley</a>, it was just <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a>. <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a> shares all memories with rayne because they are both part of the same being. <span class="restricted">therefore, rayne remembers hayden's identity crisis.</span></p>
    <h3>appearance</h3>
    <h4>physical</h4>
    <p>he's biologically male- he doesn't have feminine features! please keep this in mind!!!! however, he does have soft shoulders.</p>
    <p>his hair is naturally a light coffee brown color. he doesn't have hair anywhere but on the top of his head!</p>
    <p>his eyes are light pink.</p>
    <h4>cosmetic</h4>
    <p>rayne has dyed hair. it doesn't really matter what color dye you draw. go wild :3</p>
    <p>i try to put rayne in a different outfit every time i draw him. don't worry about a set wardrobe when drawing him, just don't do anything discriminatory or too edgy iykwim. don't be afraid to put a cute design on the shirt though!!</p>
    <p>he has a silly lil star accessory in his hair :3 it can be purple or pink you decide</p>
