    <p>rayne is my persona. he's 15, uses he/they pronouns, and is a femboy.</p>
    <h3>lore</h3>
    <p>rayne is the encompassing entity of <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a> and <a href="/c/hayley.html">hayley</a>'s personalities. he depicts traits of both personalities, both psychologically (f.e. mellow, like <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a>, but also happy-go-lucky at times, like <a href="/c/hayley.html">hayley</a>) and physically (f.e. <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a>'s hairstyle, <a href="/c/hayley.html">hayley</a>'s hairpin).</p>
    <p>note that he does NOT have multiple personality disorder: he is the result of <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a> and <a href="/c/hayley.html">hayley</a> being merged into one person and sense of self.</p>
    <p>before <a href="/c/hayley.html">hayley</a>, it was just <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a>. <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a> shares all memories with rayne because they are both part of the same being. <span class="restricted">therefore, rayne remembers <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a>'s identity crisis.</span></p>
    <h3>appearance</h3>
    <p>rayne has dyed hair (it's naturally brown). it doesn't really matter what color dye you draw but it should be a warm color (from purple to yellow).</p>
    <p>rayne is in a different outfit every time i draw him. don't worry worry about a set wardrobe when drawing him, just don't do anything discriminatory or too edgy iykwim.</p>
