    <p>hayden is a 15-year-old demiboy (he/they). he's friendly and nice to others but they've been through quite a bit. he's a very mellow and calm person.</p>
    <p><span class="restricted">he had an identity crisis a year ago, and that's how hayley (the second half of >rayne) was formed. during this 5-month period, he never felt happy and would cry a lot. he didn't know what was wrong at that made him frustrated with himself. he longed for days where he could wake up and smile. feel free to make art depicting this time of his life.</span></p>
