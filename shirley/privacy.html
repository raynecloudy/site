    		<p>rayne cloudy ("i", "me", "we", or "us") understands that privacy is important to users ("you", "user", or "users") of their discord bot ("shirley", "shirleybot", or "bot") which is used on the blueberry pancake club (<a href="https://discord.gg/jyERQVXQKg">https://discord.gg/jyERQVXQKg</a>, the "discord server"). this privacy policy ("privacy policy") was created to let users understand how and what personal information (data that could be seen as able to identify an individual) is being collected, and how it's stored. if you have any further questions, please contact rayne cloudy via email at <a href="mailto:therealraynecloudy+q@gmail.com">therealraynecloudy+q@gmail.com</a>.</p>
    		<h2>what data is collected when using shirleybot?</h2>
    		<p>no data is collected when a user is only sending messages in channels or threads on the discord server. however, if the user receives a strike on the discord server, their discord user ID will be stored in a local file on rayne's computer. it is only used to determine who has strikes on their account.</p>
