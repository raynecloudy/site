        	<p>
        		my biology teacher recently passed away<br>
        		i really don't know what to say<br>
        		i never really knew him well but<br>
        		i had his class, hey
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		i wish i had been more attentive in class<br>
        		but now it's too late<br>
        		myself, i kind of hate<br>
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		if my phone had never been out<br>
        		i probably would've had a pout<br>
        		because my phone is apparantly more important<br>
        		than the man who lovingly shouts
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		my biology teacher was loud<br>
        		always encouraged us to talk<br>
        		for that, i always walked
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		now that he's gone, i feel much guilt<br>
        		for the memories i never built<br>
        		so starting today, i'm going to<br>
        		put away the hilt
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		i'm gonna put the phone down<br>
        		and make some new friends<br>
        		that way, his legacy never ends
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		rest in peace.
        	</p>
